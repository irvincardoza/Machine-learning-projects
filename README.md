# Machine-learning-projects
This repository contains example machine learning projects made by me, of all topics based off Andrew Ng's Coursera course.

## Linear Regression

### [Single Variable Regression](https://github.com/irvincardoza/Machine-learning-projects/tree/main/singleVariable)
  
- A simple experience vs salary prediction.
- Minimizing cost function.
- Finding appropriate parameters w and b.
- Gradient Descent
  
  
### [Multi-Variable Regression](https://github.com/irvincardoza/Machine-learning-projects/tree/main/multiVariable)

- Predicting student performance based on various factors.
- 3-D representation of gradient descent algorithm.
- Dot product to calculate predictions.
- Plotting learning curve to show decreasing cost function.
