This repository contains example machine learning projects made by me, of all topics based off Andrew Ng's Coursera course.

# Linear Regression

## Single Variable Regression:
  
### 1) [A simple experience vs salary prediction](https://github.com/irvincardoza/Machine-learning-projects/tree/main/singleVariable).
- Minimizing cost function.
- Finding appropriate parameters w and b.
- Gradient Descent
  
  
## Multi-Variable Regression

### 1) [Predicting student performance based on various factors](https://github.com/irvincardoza/Machine-learning-projects/tree/main/multiVariable).
- 3-D representation of gradient descent algorithm.
- Dot product to calculate predictions.
- Plotting learning curve to show decreasing cost function.
